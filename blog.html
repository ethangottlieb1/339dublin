        <p>I had the pleasure of diving into Dublin's rich history and vibrant culture, beginning my tour at the expansive and beautiful Phoenix Park, followed by a visit to the historic old barracks used in various wars throughout Dublin's history. The solemn Arbour Hill Cemetery and Memorial, where people of Irish independence are commemorated, provided a moment of deep reflection for all of us in the class.</p>
        <p>The day concluded with a  walk through Dublin's streets, where I soaked in the unique atmosphere and vibrant city life. I capped off my exploration with a quick dinner and a visit to a couple of Irish pubs which were reccommended to me. I truly enjoyed the traditional music and warm hospitality that I experienced during my first day in Dublin.</p>

        <p>The visit to the Guinness Storehouse was a highlight of my trip, offering a unique experience where I had the opportunity to look into the art and science of brewing one of the world's most famous beers. As I walked through the various interactive exhibits, I was shocked by the complexity involved in creating each pint of perfect Guinness. From the four different ingredients to the brewing processes to the precision and science behind pouring the perfect glass, every step was meticulously detailed, which truly grew my appreciation for the Guinness product.</p>
        <p>The design of the Guinness Storehouse itself added an extraordinary touch to the experience. I felt like I was in the Willy Wonka movie. It made it feel like more of a journey through a fantasy world than a simple factory tour. I left the storehouse having had a truly incredible experience.</p>

        <p>The guest lecture was super interesting. I found Dr David Williams to be a great lecturer as he was super engaging and was a very eloquent speaker. It was really cool to learn about gamification and his work toward his PhD. I loved how he spoke about the different types of games he has worked on throughout his career and how each development process offers a completely different experience and feeling towards the end. </p>
        <p>Additionally, Anna Leary offered a very cool perspective. She spoke about the real life application of gamification through her role in turning a library into a website. I had a great time critiquing the old library website and it was cool to see all the changes she has made to this date.</p>

        <p>Class went very well. We continued to work on our wesbite projects and I had a great time learning about new HTML and CSS styles. Later on in the day, the class visited the EPIC Museum. It was really cool to get a proper understanding as to how Irish Emigration has changed and impacted the world over the years. </p>
        <p>After the museum, I went to the Dublin Zoo. I had tons of fun. First, I started off at the Elephant exhibit and then made my way over to the monkeys and gorillas. It was really cool to see different kinds of animals that I don't typically see at zoos back at home. I ended my day walking through Phoenix Park which was incredible because of the amazing weather we have been blessed with.</p>
