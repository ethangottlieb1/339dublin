        <p>I had a great time exploring Dublin and getting a taste of the rich history and culture surrounding this beautiful city. We started the tour off at Phoenix Park which was beautiful. We then drove over to old barracks used in the war. Then we went to the Arbour Hill Cemetary/Memorial which was a moving experience. We ended the tour with a walk through the city. After, I ended my day going out to dinner and exploring some of the Irish Pubs!</p>

        <p>The Guinness Storehouse was a very cool experience. It was super interesting to learn about all the intricate details and the science behind making a pint of Guinness. The Guinness Storehouse felt more like a building out of Willy Wonka than a regular old factory. I had a blast!</p>
